Hi! 👋

I am Lorenzo Agnolucci, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Roblox](https://corp.roblox.com) in San Mateo, CA, where I work on content understanding for large-scale recommendation systems.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) in Italy, under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Bertini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SBm9ZpYAAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, my main research interests revolved around image quality assessment and multimodal learning.

As part of my PhD journey, I also worked as a Research Intern at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) in Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of [Vlad Hosu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IzTZ1tAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Daisuke Iso](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=VZ-25XwAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on image quality assessment.
